# Conference Builder

This project is very much inspired by the NCAA conference realignments of Summer 2021. The idea is for users to be able to pick and choose all the teams they'd want in their conferences, as well as putting together the pods.

## Data scraping

Part of this project is gathering the current data (despite that changing every day it seems). This is achieved through a cheerio script that scrapes data off of Wikipedia.
